# nate_assignment

### This is a test assignment following the instructions found at https://github.com/NateAI/nate.challenge.ios
### Submitted by Kali Spassov, ophenix.nya@gmail.com

# Before running
### Make sure you run 'pod install' in the root folder.

# Work done:
### Core deliverables in the VCs completed.
### Bonus work, I make the cells in the main page rotate on thier own, IDK why, it seemed like fun.

# Incomplete:
### Deliverable request was for unit tests in the controllers, I only did parsing unit tests. I have very little working experience with UI unit tests and didn't want to guess on how it's done correctly. 

### If you come across any issues running the project let me know at ophenix.nya@gmail.com
